# Project 4
In this project, A web application will be deployed to leveraging multiple Docker images. We will orchestrate a multi-container setup using Docker Compose, hosting the web application containers environment on the AWS cloud to make it accessible via the public internet.
Project Setup
## Requirements

1. **Create or Leverage a Web App**: Develop or use a web app that is publicly available, such as on GitHub.
2. **Multiple Microservices**: The web app environment should contain 2 or more microservices that communicate with each other. For instance, it could include an API app that makes calls to a database.
3. **Dockerize the App(s) and/or Database(s)**: Create Dockerfiles with instructions to create the respective Docker images for the app(s), microservice(s), and database(s).
4. **DockerHub Account**: Create a DockerHub account if you donâ€™t have one already and push the Docker images to your DockerHub registry.
5. **Build Docker Images**: Build the Docker images in both x86_64 and arm64 formats, for example, using Docker Buildx tool.
6. **Deploy with Docker Compose on AWS**: Deploy and orchestrate the containers with Docker Compose on AWS.
7. **EC2 Instance**: Create and launch an EC2 instance to serve as the container server to host your app containers.
8. **Install Docker Engine and Docker Compose**: On the EC2 server, download and install Docker Engine and Docker Compose.
9. **Docker Compose Configuration**: Create a docker-compose.yaml file containing the configurations necessary to run your multi-container setup with Docker Compose.
10. **Launch and Run Containers**: Launch and run your containers on the server with Docker Compose and ensure they are accessible via the public internet.
