# Project 5

## Project Description
In this project an API microservice connected to a database on AWS cloud infrastructure will be deployed. The API will have exposed endpoints that users can send HTTP requests to and get responses, with data returned as JSON payloads. The AWS infrastructure will include components like a VPC, internet gateway, public subnet, public route table, and EC2 instances.

## Requirements
**Database Creation:** <br>Create a database to store data (e.g., NHL player stats) using any database server (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.).</span>
<br>**API Server:** <br>Create an API server using any programming language and framework (e.g., FastAPI, Node.js + Express, Java Spring Boot).
<br>**Endpoints:** <br>Create GET endpoints for retrieving data from the database (e.g., /players, /toronto, /points).
<br>**Deployment:** <br>Deploy the database server and API microservice on AWS cloud, ensuring accessibility on the public internet.
